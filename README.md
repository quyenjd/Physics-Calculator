# Physics Calculator

A simple calculator that deep-learns formulas and organizes a structure that helps you find suitable formulas with given arguments.

The project was started because the owner was too lazy to find formulas from books.

## Installation

1. Download the source.
2. Compile the `physics.cpp` file (with `exprtk.hpp`).

## How to use

You just need to read and follow the instructions from the program carefully.

Because no data has been done, you will have to start over by using the program to create your structure. Don't worry! We've got your back.

## Changelog

Initial release.

```
// - Support constants, functions, variables and formulas structure.
// - You can add new constant, function, variable and formula.
// - Auto find suitable formulas and calculate them with "solve" command.
// - Error checking and reporting is available.
// - "brainstorm" helps generating new formula by joining some of available formulas. triggered by "formula" command.
// - Optimization is not good.
```
