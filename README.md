# Physics Calculator

A simple calculator that deep-learns formulas and organizes a structure that helps you find suitable formulas with given arguments.

The project was started because the owner was too lazy to find formulas from books.

## Installation

1. Download all the source.
2. Compile the `physics.cpp` file (with `exprtk.hpp`). C++11 or above is recommended.

## How to use

You just need to read and follow the instructions from the program carefully.

## Functions

```
// - Support hashes, constants, functions, variables and formulas structure.
// - You can add new constant, function, variable and formula.
// - Auto find suitable formulas and calculate them with "solve" command.
// - Error checking and reporting.
// - "brainstorm" helps generating new formula by joining some of available formulas. triggered by "formula" command.
// - Optimization is better now.
```

*Please note that `brainstorm` only replaces variables by formulas. It can't help solve equations.*
